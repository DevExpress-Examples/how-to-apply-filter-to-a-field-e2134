# How to: Apply Filter to a Field


<p>This example shows how to apply a filter to a field. For this, a new FilterFieldValues method was created. <br>The first condition will select records which contain 'UK' in the 'fieldCountry' field. The second condition will filter the 'Category' field to display only four categories: 'Beverages', 'Condiments', 'Seafood', and 'Produce'.</p>
